# nhentai_dl_script

A really, really, lazy way to download and prep images for use with [hent-AI](https://github.com/natethegreate/hent-AI) and [DeepCreamPy](https://github.com/deeppomf/DeepCreamPy).

## What does it do?

Uses the NHentai API to scrape all the actual images of a given doujin ID. Can also convert those images from jpg (nHentai default) to png for you to use with...certain AI scripts...

## Usage

1. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

2. ```python3 nhentai_dl.py```

3. It'll walk you through the rest!
